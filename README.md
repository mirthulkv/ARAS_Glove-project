## 🔍 Overview

**ARAS** (the on-device Bluetooth codename used in firmware, short for the project's internal identifier) is a wearable, glove-based safety system for two-wheeler riders. It combines physiological monitoring, motion-based accident detection, and radar-based collision sensing into a single low-cost embedded platform — something most existing rider-safety research treats as separate, siloed systems (helmet-only accident detection, vision-only collision warning, or standalone health monitors).

The system is built around an **ESP32** microcontroller and three sensors — a **MAX30102** pulse oximeter, an **MPU-6050** IMU, and an **RCWL-0516** microwave radar module — plus two coin vibration motors for distinct, non-visual haptic alerts. When the onboard firmware detects a likely accident, it transmits an SOS message over Bluetooth Classic (SPP) to a paired **Android companion app**, which fetches the rider's GPS location and automatically sends an emergency SMS to a pre-configured contact.

This repository contains **both halves of the working system**:
1. `firmware/` — the ESP32 embedded firmware (sensor fusion, HRV analysis, alert logic, BT SOS transmission)
2. `android-app/` — the Android (Kotlin) companion app that listens for the BT SOS signal and sends the emergency SMS with a live GPS link

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Two-wheeler riders are among the most vulnerable road users, yet most Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) research and tooling targets four-wheelers. Existing two-wheeler safety work tends to address only one dimension at a time:

- Helmet-based accident detection *or*
- Vision/radar-based frontal collision warning *or*
- Standalone wearable heart-rate monitoring

ARAS integrates all three into a single **glove-worn** device — chosen over a helmet or vehicle mount because a glove gives direct skin contact for accurate pulse sensing, delivers haptic feedback right at the rider's hand, and is comfortable enough for everyday wear.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Sensor-fused drowsiness detection** — Heart Rate Variability (RMSSD) computed from real-time PPG peak intervals, combined with a low-motion check, to flag fatigue rather than relying on raw heart rate alone.
- **Bidirectional-ready collision sensing** — RCWL-0516 microwave radar detects nearby moving objects with a debounced cooldown to avoid alert spam.
- **Accident detection** — MPU-6050 acceleration-magnitude thresholding flags sudden impacts/falls in real time.
- **Priority-based alert arbitration** — Accident alerts always pre-empt drowsiness and proximity alerts; each alert type has a distinct vibration pattern so the rider can distinguish them without looking down.
- **Bluetooth SOS bridge** — On accident detection, the ESP32 pushes an `SOS:ACCIDENT|TIME:<ms>` message over Bluetooth Serial (SPP) to a paired phone.
- **Automatic emergency SMS** — The Android app listens continuously, grabs a high-accuracy GPS fix (with a `lastLocation` fallback), and sends a Google-Maps-linked SMS to a preconfigured emergency contact — including dual-SIM handling.
- **Production-shaped Android app** — Runtime permission handling for BT/location/SMS (including Android 12+ `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`/`BLUETOOTH_SCAN`), a foreground-service scaffold (`SOSForegroundService.kt`) for background reliability, and a live connection/log UI.

## 🧠 How the Safety Algorithms Work

### 1. Heart-Rate-Variability (HRV) Drowsiness Detection
Rather than triggering on absolute heart rate (which varies a lot rider-to-rider), the firmware:
1. Detects PPG peaks from the smoothed MAX30102 IR signal.
2. Computes **Inter-Beat Intervals (IBI)** between peaks, with artifact rejection (rejects physiologically implausible IBIs and beats that deviate >35% from the previous interval).
3. Computes **RMSSD** (root mean square of successive IBI differences) — a standard short-term HRV metric — over a rolling 20-beat window.
4. Builds a **personal RMSSD baseline** from the first 15 stable readings.
5. Flags drowsiness when RMSSD **drops more than 30%** below that baseline *and* the rider's hand shows abnormally low motion — combining two independent signals to reduce false positives.

### 2. Accident Detection
The MPU-6050's 3-axis acceleration magnitude is continuously compared against a 1g baseline; a spike above a fixed threshold (`> 3g`) is treated as a probable fall/impact and immediately triggers the highest-priority alert — checked independently on every loop iteration, not just during heartbeat samples.

### 3. Collision / Proximity Detection
The RCWL-0516 radar module outputs a digital HIGH when it detects a moving object nearby. A 2-second cooldown debounces repeated triggers into a single alert event.

### 4. Priority-Based Alert Arbitration
```
Priority:  ACCIDENT (3)  >  DROWSINESS (2)  >  OBJECT_DETECTED (1)  >  NONE (0)
```
A new alert only overrides the current one if it's higher priority, or if the current alert's display duration has expired — preventing rapid flicker between simultaneous conditions while still guaranteeing an accident alert is never suppressed.

### 5. Bluetooth SOS Bridge
Only `ACCIDENT`-level alerts push a message over Bluetooth SPP (`SOS:ACCIDENT|TIME:<millis>`); the Android app treats any inbound chunk containing the substring `"SOS"` as a trigger, fetches a GPS fix, and sends the emergency SMS.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Firmware (ESP32)
1. Open `firmware/ARAS_Glove_Firmware.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
2. Install libraries: `Wire` (built-in), `MPU6050` (Electronic Cats / jrowberg i2cdevlib), `MAX30105` (SparkFun MAX3010x), `BluetoothSerial` (built-in ESP32 core).
3. Wire the sensors per [`firmware/README.md`](README2.md).
4. Flash to the ESP32 (board: "ESP32 Dev Module"). On boot it advertises Bluetooth as `ARAS_GLOVE`.

### Android App
1. Open `android-app/` in Android Studio.
2. In `app/src/main/java/com/sos/emergency/MainActivity.kt`, set:
   ```kotlin
   private val SOS_PHONE_NUMBER = "+91XXXXXXXXXX"   // your emergency contact
   private val ESP32_DEVICE_NAME = "ARAS_GLOVE"      // must match firmware's SerialBT.begin(...)
   ```
3. Pair the ESP32 with your phone via Android Bluetooth settings first (device name must match).
4. Build & run on a device with API 23+, grant all requested permissions (Bluetooth, Location, SMS).
5. Tap **Connect** — the app will show "Listening for SOS…" once connected.

> ⚠️ **Before pushing to a public repo / résumé link:** the phone number field is already redacted to a placeholder in this copy. Never commit a real personal phone number to a public repository.
